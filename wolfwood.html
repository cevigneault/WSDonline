		<p><strong>Nicholas D. Wolfwood</strong> A superb gunman, almost equal to Vash himself, and arguably the most skilled human being with a pistol in the series, Wolfwood is a priest who wields an enormous cross "to carry his sins", however, the cross contains a machine gun and a rack of automatic pistols. Wolfwood and Vash get into many conflicts over the morality of murder. According to Wolfwood's mentor "...we are sometimes driven to become the devil himself." Wolfwood is a tragic figure in that his redemption comes at a terrible cost. <a href="index.html">Back</a></p>
