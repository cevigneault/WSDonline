		<h2>Plot</h2>
		<p>Known for its Space Western theme, Trigun is about a man named "Vash the Stampede" and the two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees who follow him around in order to minimize the damages inevitably caused by his appearance. Most of the damage attributed to Vash is actually caused by bounty hunters in pursuit of the "60,000,000,000$$" (sixty billion "double dollars") bounty on Vash's head for the destruction of the city of July. However, he cannot remember the incident due to retrograde amnesia, being able to recall only fragments of the destroyed city and memories of his childhood past. Throughout his travels, Vash tries to save lives using non-lethal force. He is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who, like Vash, is a superb gunfighter with a mysterious past.</p>
		<p>As the series progresses, we learn more about Vash's mysterious history and the history of human civilization on the planet Gunsmoke. The series often employs comic relief and is mostly light-hearted although its tone shifts toward darker and more dramatic situations as the series draws to a conclusion. The story line also involves moral conflict pertaining to the morality of killing other living things</p>

				<p><strong>Vash the Stampede</strong> is the main character of the anime and manga series of Trigun created by Yasuhiro Nightow. He is a Plant, inter-dimensional beings that are tapped as a source of power and energy, and being so gives him superhuman powers and a capability to destroy cities, thus acquiring the name <em>The Humanoid Typhoon</em> due to the destruction &amp; chaos which surrounds him, and subsequently <em>The $$60,000,000,000.00 Man</em>, because of the price on his head. He travels from town to town, keeping the peace and teaching townsfolk the value of it.</p>

				<p><strong>Meryl Stryfe</strong> and <strong>Milly Thompson</strong> are two agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Company, sent to evaluate claims regarding the Humanoid Typhoon. Initially, they dismiss the idea that the real Vash is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon (partially due to the lack of an introduction), but the two eventually learn (much to Meryl's dismay) that this is indeed the person they are assigned to track.</p>

				<p><strong>Nicholas D. Wolfwood</strong> A superb gunman, almost equal to Vash himself, and arguably the most skilled human being with a pistol in the series, Wolfwood is a priest who wields an enormous cross "to carry his sins", however, the cross contains a machine gun and a rack of automatic pistols. Wolfwood and Vash get into many conflicts over the morality of murder. According to Wolfwood's mentor "...we are sometimes driven to become the devil himself." Wolfwood is a tragic figure in that his redemption comes at a terrible cost.</p>
