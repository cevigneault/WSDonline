			<p><strong>Knives Millions</strong> The main antagonist, and Vash's brother. Like Vash, he is a sentient power plant created by humans but unlike him, he is a cruel mass murderer that intends to wipe out the entire human race, considering them unfit for this world. Most of the situations Vash ends up in are, in one way or another, connected to Knives. </p>
