He is a Plant, inter-dimensional beings that are tapped as a source of power and energy, and being so gives him superhuman powers and a capability to destroy cities, thus acquiring the name <em>The Humanoid Typhoon</em> due to the destruction &amp; chaos which surrounds him, and subsequently <em>The $$60,000,000,000.00 Man</em>, because of the price on his head. He travels from town to town, keeping the peace and teaching townsfolk the value of it.</p>

					<p><strong>Meryl Stryfe</strong> and <strong>Milly Thompson</strong> are two agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Company, sent to evaluate claims regarding the Humanoid Typhoon. Initially, they dismiss the idea that the real Vash is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon (partially due to the lack of an introduction), but the two eventually learn (much to Meryl's dismay) that this is indeed the person they are assigned to track.</p>
